# ActiveType Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased changes
* Fixed: `nests_one` association record building used empty hash instead of passed in attributes. Credit to @chriscz.

## 1.3.1 (2020-03-31)
* Fixed: Avoid #change_association breaking for polymorphic associations. Thanks to @lucthev.


## 1.3.0 (2019-09-26)

* Fixed: Do not override Rails internal methods when definining an attribute called `:attribute`.
* Fixed: Fix .find for extended records, when a record had a `#type` column that was not used for
  single table inheritance. Thanks to @fsateler.
* Changed: When extending a single table inheritance base class, `.find` no longer crashes, but
  returns records derived from the extended class.

  This means, that given the following class hierarchy:

  ```ruby
  class Parent < ActiveRecord::Base
  end

  class ExtendedParent < ActiveType::Record[Parent]
  end

  class Child < Parent
  end
  ```

  querying

  ```
  ExtendedParent.all
  ```

  will no longer crash, but always return records of type `ExtendedParent` (*even if they
  would normally of type `Child`*). You should probably avoid this weird situation and not
  extend STI Parent classes.

  Thanks to @fsateler.


## 1.2.1 (2019-07-03)
* Fixed: Eager loading in Rails 6 no longer crashes trying to load `ActiveType::Object`s.
  Thanks to @teamhqapp for the fix.


## 1.2.0 (2019-06-18)

* Fixed: Using `has_many` et al in an extended record ignored given scopes.
* Added: `change_association` on ActiveType::Record to change assocation options.


## 1.1.1 (2019-05-07)

* Improved dirty tracking (`#changes?` etc) for virtual attributes to bring it more in line with
  the behaviour of non-virtual attributes. Behaviour with ActiveRecord < 4 remains unchanged.
  Thanks to @lowski.

## 1.1.0 (2019-03-04)

* For some use cases, users need to access ActiveRecord's original `.attribute` method, which ActiveType overrides. We now alias `.attribute` as `.ar_attribute`.
* In a `ActiveRecord::Record[MyRecord]`, `.has_many` now guesses `"my_record_id"` as the foreign key. Same for `.has_one`.

## 1.0.0 (2019-02-15)

* No code changes.
* Modernize list of supported Rails versions and Rubies.


## 0.7.5 (2017-12-04)

* Fixed an `chird record did not match id` exception introduced in the 0.7.3 update when using `nests_one`. Credit to @cerdiogenes.


## 0.7.4 (2017-09-01)

* Bugfix: ActiveType.cast sets #type correctly when casting to an STI class

## 0.7.3 (2017-08-16)

* `nests_many` / `nests_one` will now work for nested records with non-integer primary keys.


## 0.7.2 (2017-07-31)

* Fixed a bug when converting datetimes from certain strings. This occured if the string included an explicit time zone (i.e. `record.date_time = '2017-07-31 12:30+03:00'`), which was not the local time.

## 0.7.1 (2017-06-19)

* ActiveType::Object no longer requires a database connection on Rails 5+ (it never did on Rails 3 or 4).

## 0.7.0 (2017-04-21)

* Support `index_errors: true` for `nest_many`.

## 0.6.4 (2017-02-27)

* Fix an issue when using `ActiveType.cast` "too early".

## 0.6.3 (2017-01-30)

* Fix a load error when using `ActiveType::Object` before using `ActiveRecord::Base` within a Rails app.

## 0.6.2 (2017-01-30)

* When used with Rails, defer loading to not interfere with `ActiveRecord` configuration in initializers.

## 0.6.1 (2016-12-05)

* Remove spec folder from packaged gem.

## 0.6.0 (2016-07-05)

* Drop support for 1.8.7.
* Rails 5 compatibility.

## 0.5.1 (2016-05-09)
